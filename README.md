# Snake-Game-on-Atmega32
On Atmega32 microcontroller, I implemented a nostalgic snake game by using 8x8 LED matric and xy analog joystick module. 
As a programming language, I used AVR C.

Used Knowledge:
- ADC and ADC Interrupt 
- SPI communication method
- Seven Segment displaying method by using MAXI7219
- Snake Game algorithm implementation with AVR C
